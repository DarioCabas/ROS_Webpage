## Getting Started🚀


_These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See_ **_Deployment_** _for notes on how to deploy the project ._


## Prerequisites:clipboard:

_What things you need to install the software and how to install them_

```
Give examples
```

### Installing🔧

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests ⚙️
